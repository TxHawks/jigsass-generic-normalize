# JigSass Generic Normalize
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]  [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]   

 > Modular, configurable, opt-in browser normalization

JigSass Normalize is a modularized and configurable version of Nicolas Gallagher and
Jonathan Neal's [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) at version 4.0.0.

Normalize.css is a modern alternative to css resets, which preserves useful defaults and corrects
bugs and common browser inconsistencies.

## Installation

Using npm:

```sh
npm i -S jigsass-generic-normalize
```

## Usage

```scss
  @import 'path/to/jigsass-generic-normalize'/scss/index;
```

Jigsass Normalize will not output any CSS, unless explicitly included using one of the mixins.

Jigsass Normalize's 
[configuration variables](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-generic-normalize#variables) allow 
overriding the very few default opinionated choices made by `normalize.css`.

To include all or parts of JigSass Normalize's submodules, use the 
[`jigsass-normalize`](https://txhawks.github.io/jigsass-generic-normalize#mixin-jigsass-normalize)
mixin.

JigSass Normalize also offers shortcut mixins for including each of the submodules. 

The styles of each JigSass Normalize submodule will only be included a single time, 
they are included.

## Extended details and known issues

Additional detail and explanation of the esoteric parts of normalize.css.

#### `pre, code, kbd, samp`

The `font-family: monospace, monospace` hack fixes the inheritance and scaling
of font-size for preformatted text. The duplication of `monospace` is
intentional. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Davidgothberg/Test59).

#### `sub, sup`

Normally, using `sub` or `sup` affects the line-box height of text in all
browsers. [Source](https://gist.github.com/413930).

#### `svg:not(:root)`

Adding `overflow: hidden` fixes IE9's SVG rendering. Earlier versions of IE
don't support SVG, so we can safely use the `:not()` and `:root` selectors that
modern browsers use in the default UA stylesheets to apply this style. [Source]
(https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svg-wg/2008JulSep/0339.html).

#### `select`

By default, Chrome on OS X and Safari on OS X allow very limited styling of
`select`, unless a border property is set. The default font weight on `optgroup`
elements cannot safely be changed in Chrome on OSX and Safari on OS X.

#### `[type="checkbox"]`

It is recommended that you do not style checkbox and radio inputs as Firefox's
implementation does not respect box-sizing, padding, or width.

#### `[type="number"]`

Certain font size values applied to number inputs cause the cursor style of the
decrement button to change from `default` to `text`.

#### `[type="search"]`

The search input is not fully stylable by default. In Chrome and Safari on
OSX/iOS you can't control `font`, `padding`, `border`, or `background`. In
Chrome and Safari on Windows you can't control `border` properly. It will apply
`border-width` but will only show a border color (which cannot be controlled)
for the outer 1px of that border. Applying `-webkit-appearance: textfield`
addresses these issues without removing the benefits of search inputs (e.g.
showing past searches). Safari (but not Chrome) will clip the cancel button on
when it has padding (and `textfield` appearance).

## Development

It is a best practice for JigSass modules to *not* automatically generate css on `@import`, but 
rather have to user explicitly enable the generation of specific styles from the module.

Contributions in the form of pull-requests, issues, bug reports, etc. are welcome.
Please feel free to fork, hack or modify JigSass Generic Normalize in any way you see fit.

#### Writing documentation

Good documentation is crucial for scalability and maintainability. When contributing,
please do make sure that all Sass functionality (functions, mixins, 
variables and placeholder selectors) is well documented.

Documentation is auto-generated using [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/)

#### Running tests
`gulp lint` will, well, lint the contents scss files in the `scss` directory.

`gulp test` with run module's test using Mocha and Sassaby.

`gulp tdd` will watch both the Sass files and the test specs for changes, and will
run tests automatically upon them.

#### Writing tests

JigSass Generic Normalize tests are written using [Sassaby](https://github.com/ryanbahniuk/sassaby)
and Mocha. Spec files are located in the `test` directory.

Mocha allows us to place a call to `before()` in the root of any test file and it 
will be run once, before all the other tests in every `test_*.js` file. 
We can also `require()` files and assign them to the global object to make them 
available to all `test_*.js` files. 

jigsass-generic-normalize uses a file called `helper.js` can be used to set up mocha 
globals requires and `before()`.

In addition to Sassaby's testing functions, jigsass-generic-normalize makes a few Sass
functions available to the test suite, for use inside Sassaby tests:

<dl>
  <dt>jig-var-equals($value, $var) -> {boolean}<dt>
  <dd>
		Check if a variable equals a value.<br />
		<strong>$value</strong> {*}: A value to compare the value of $var to.<br />
		<strong>$var</strong> {*}: The variable to test<br />
	</dd>
  <dt>jig-var-type-is($type, $var) -> {boolean}<dt>
  <dd>
		Check if a variable is of a certain type.<br />
		<strong>$type</strong> {string}: A type to compare with the type of $var.<br />
		<strong>$var</strong> {*}: The variable to test<br />
	</dd>
  <dt>jig-map-key-equals($value, $map, $keys...) -> {boolean}<dt>
  <dd>
		Check if a map's key is assigned a cerain value.<br />
		<strong>$value</strong> {*}:  A value to compare the value of a key in $map with.<br />
		<strong>$map</strong> {map}: The map to test.<br />
		<strong>$keys... </strong> {arglist}: A recursive chain of keys.<br />
	</dd>
  <dt>jig-map-key-type-is($type, $map, keys...) -> {boolean}<dt>
  <dd>
		Check if a map's key is of a certain type<br />
		<strong>$type</strong> {string}: A type to compare with the type of $var.<br />
		<strong>$map</strong> {map}: The map to test.<br />
		<strong>$keys... </strong> {arglist}: A recursive chain of keys.<br />
	</dd>
</dl>
